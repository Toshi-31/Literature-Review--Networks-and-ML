Motivated by the complexity introduced by heterogeneous vendor-specific configuration languages in network management, the paper seeks to bridge the gap between NLP techniques and network management challenges. By reviewing the state-of-the-art in both domains and drawing parallels, the research seeks to understand the feasibility, challenges, and potential benefits of leveraging NLP techniques in network configuration tasks, providing insights and a roadmap for future research in this interdisciplinary area. The problem statement revolves around addressing the challenges posed by diverse network configuration languages and exploring whether NLP techniques can offer solutions for improved automation and efficiency in network management.

NLP for ‘‘network language’’ processing
 NLP potential for network configuration
In configuration verification, the focus lies on ensuring the correctness and compliance of network configurations, detecting anomalies such as black holes or loops. Existing approaches rely heavily on formal methods, often involving human experts. The potential for NLP methods arises in utilizing language models trained on correct configurations to spot misconfigurations or inconsistencies. Additionally, a supervised layer fine-tuned on correct configurations could aid in error repair, offering operators a streamlined process for syntax and reachability error detection, along with policy verification, ultimately simplifying network management tasks.

Configuration synthesis involves generating device configurations to meet customer requests or optimize resources based on network conditions. The challenge lies in automating this generative process, aligning with the goal of intent-based networking. NLP tools could assist by interpreting high-level specification languages describing reachability requirements and generating corresponding configurations. This approach would empower operators to articulate requirements in a user-friendly manner, leaving the NLP agent to handle the intricacies of configuration generation.

Configuration translation addresses the complexity introduced by heterogeneous fleets of network devices using proprietary languages. NLP techniques offer potential solutions by learning to automatically translate between configuration languages of various vendors. This capability not only facilitates the realization of a unified language for network control but also simplifies network management tasks such as device migration. By submitting legacy configuration lines, operators could obtain translations into the target language, easing the transition between different vendor environments and promoting the vision of self-driving networks.

Current state of the art in network configuration
1. Configuration Verification: Current methods for network configuration verification rely heavily on rule-based and formal approaches, such as graph models and explicit state model checking. Despite the critical nature of this task, NLP techniques have not been fully utilized in this domain. However, there is potential for NLP to assist in anomaly detection and policy verification by leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection methods or broadening the scope of exact methods through the interpretation of operator intents using NLP representations.

2. Configuration Synthesis: Automatic generation of network configurations is an active area of research, with existing methods focusing on transforming high-level specifications into configuration updates or synthesizing configurations from requirements. While current approaches employ algorithms like SMT or datalog, there's room to explore the extent to which NLP advancements could aid in simplifying the process for network experts, allowing them to express intents in a concise language while leveraging NLP for configuration generation.

3. Configuration Explanation: While translation of configurations across languages has received less attention, explaining and summarizing configurations for human operators is gaining traction. Methods like Net2text aim to generate interpretable text explaining network behavior, while Config2spec transforms configurations into formal specifications. NLP techniques, particularly those with generative abilities like GPT-3, hold promise in providing comments and explanations in natural language, aiding operators in understanding complex configurations more intuitively.
 NLP for ‘‘computer language’’ processing
1. Code Verification: Recent efforts have explored using neural networks and NLP for bug detection and code verification. While existing techniques have shown good quantitative performance, they often struggle with understanding obvious program properties. Notable advancements include methods like Code2vec, which transforms code into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and learns embeddings to predict method names, and approaches that complement local context from AST with global context from Program Dependence Graphs (PDG) and Data Flow Graphs (DFG). These advancements demonstrate the potential of leveraging NLP representations to improve code verification.

2. Code Synthesis: Code synthesis aims to generate code snippets from natural language descriptions or function names. Machine learning approaches, such as PLBART and Open AI Codex, have shown promising results in generating code from high-level descriptions. These approaches leverage pre-trained large language models and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in code summarization, synthesis, and translation. The availability of large amounts of commented code online has been instrumental in fine-tuning language models for code synthesis tasks.

3. Code Translation: Inspired by the success of deep learning in NLP translation, recent work has focused on translating code between programming languages. Techniques like leveraging transformer architectures have shown promising results in finding a common latent representation between languages, enabling accurate translation. Moreover, methods like automated unit-testing have been proposed to filter incorrectly generated code, addressing limitations of previous approaches.

4. Other Software-related Tasks: Beyond code verification, synthesis, and translation, other software-related tasks such as automated code documentation and code completion/repair are being investigated. Models like CodeTrans are capable of performing tasks like code documentation generation and source code summarization, which could potentially find applications in network configuration explanation and completion. Additionally, advancements in automated code repair techniques, such as Break-It-Fix-It (BIFI), could be beneficial in improving the robustness of network configurations.

Transfer from programming to configuration languages: a reality check
1. Specificity of Programming Languages: Current NLP approaches for programming languages face challenges in understanding the specific semantics of code, which differ from natural language. Expert features such as data flow graphs have been used to address this, but simplistic models and poor-quality training data still hinder performance, leading to reliance on user-defined variables and function names. Similar challenges can be expected in network configuration languages, which also have structured semantics.

2. Model Complexity and Training Cost: Models for programming languages exhibit high complexity, with parameters ranging from millions to billions, comparable to natural language models. This complexity arises from the need to handle both natural language and code inputs during training. Similarly, training large models for network configuration languages would require significant resources, making it more feasible to start from pre-trained models and fine-tune them with hybrid language data.

3. Data Availability and Corpus Sizes: Availability of large, high-quality datasets is crucial for training NLP models. While programming languages benefit from abundant online data sources, network configuration data is scarce, posing a challenge for training effective models. Pooling datasets or synthetically generating configurations may mitigate this limitation, but challenges remain in ensuring data quality and diversity.

4. Input Pre-processing: Pre-processing of input data, such as extracting Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) from code, is necessary for both programming languages and network configuration languages. However, network configuration languages often contain numerous identifiers with local semantics, posing challenges for pre-processing and representation learning compared to the relatively simple syntax of programming languages.

5. Expected Performance: Despite progress in NLP for programming languages, current models perform well on simple tasks but may struggle with more complex and realistic scenarios. Evaluation benchmarks often consist of relatively simple problems, and assessing the quality of generated code remains challenging. Similar limitations can be expected in network configuration tasks, where achieving high reliability is crucial, and ML-generated configurations may require extensive verification and correction. Collaboration between humans and AI, along with the development of proper verification and debugging tools, may help address these challenges.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the application of NLP to automated network configuration holds significant potential but also presents notable challenges. While the computational and data requirements for training NLP models are feasible for large vendors and ISPs, the scarcity of high-quality configuration examples poses a barrier for the broader academic community. Configuration verification shows promise for anomaly detection, albeit with the need for rigorous verification due to potential false positives. Configuration synthesis and translation remain in early stages, with reliability being a critical concern. Despite these challenges, the growing trend of applying NLP techniques to networking problems suggests that further research will enhance the availability and applicability of NLP tools for network configuration tasks. However, it's crucial to recognize the differences between programming languages and network configuration languages, as the latter may require more thorough manual checking of automatically generated configurations until NLP tools reach a higher level of reliability.
